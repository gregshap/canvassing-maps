Canvassing Maps
===============

The goal of this project was to map progressive social organizing by county in the United States, during one of the peak weekends of the 2014 campaign cycle.

The intensity of organizing effort is measured in the count of canvasses for each US county. Each canvass represents a phonecall, doorknock, event sign in, or similar record of interaction between an organization and some person or household. The count of canvasses is based on activity in NGP VAN software, aggregated across a range of progressive organizations including the DNC, individual campaigns, ballot measure initiatives, labor unions, and non-profits all generally considered aligned to the political left.
